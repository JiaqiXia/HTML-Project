            For thousands of years, Taiwan had been home to nine plains tribes.
            The island has attracted explorers for centuries that have come to
            mine sulfur, gold, and other natural resources.

            Han Chinese began crossing the Taiwan Strait during the 15th
            century. Then, the Spanish invaded Taiwan in 1626 and, with the help
            of the Ketagalan (one of the plains tribes), discovered sulfur, a
            main ingredient in gunpowder, in Yangmingshan, a mountain range that
            overlooks Taipei. After the Spanish and Dutch were forced out of
            Taiwan, Mainland Chinese returned in 1697 to mine sulfur after a
            huge fire in China destroyed 300 tons of sulfur.

            Prospectors looking for gold started arriving in the late Qing
            Dynasty after railroad workers found gold while washing their lunch
            boxes in the Keelung River, 45 minutes northeast of Taipei. During
            this age of maritime discovery, legends claimed there was a treasure
            island full of gold.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Explorers headed to Taiwan in search of gold. During the early 17th
            century, both the Spanish and the Dutch attempted to colonize
            Taiwan, then called Formosa, as part of the ongoing competition
            among European powers for increased trade and power. The Spanish
            colony was on the north of the island, and the Dutch settled in the
            south. After several years, the Dutch emerged victorious until they,
            too, were ejected from Taiwan by anti-Qing dynasty rebels.
