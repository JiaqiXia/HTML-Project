            After the Manchus overthrew the Ming Dynasty on the Chinese
            mainland, the rebel Ming loyalist Koxinga retreated to Taiwan in
            1662 and drove out the Dutch, establishing ethnic Chinese control
            over the island. Koxinga’s forces were defeated by the Manchu Qing
            Dynasty’s forces in 1683 and parts of Taiwan began to come under the
            control of the Qing empire. During this time, many aborigines
            retreated to the mountains where many remain to this day. During the
            Sino-French War (1884-1885), Chinese forces routed French troops in
            battles in northeastern Taiwan. In 1885, the Qing empire designated
            Taiwan as China’s 22nd province.

            The Japanese, who had had their eye on Taiwan since the late 16th
            century, succeeded in gaining control of the island after China was
            defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895). When China lost
            the war with Japan in 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan as a colony
            and the Japanese occupied Taiwan from 1895 to 1945.

            After Japan’s defeat in World War II, Japan relinquished control of
            Taiwan and the government of the Republic of China (ROC), led by
            Chiang Kai-shek’s Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), re-established
            Chinese control over the island. After the Chinese Communists
            defeated ROC government forces in the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949),
            the KMT-led ROC regime retreated to Taiwan and established the
            island as a base of operations to fight back to the Chinese
            mainland.

            The new People’s Republic of China (PRC) government on the mainland,
            led by Mao Zedong, began preparations to “liberate” Taiwan by
            military force. This began a period of Taiwan’s de facto political
            independence from the Chinese mainland which continues today.
