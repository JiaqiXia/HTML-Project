          <p>
            When the Korean War broke out in 1950, the United States, seeking to
            prevent the further spread of communism in Asia, sent the Seventh
            Fleet to patrol the Taiwan Strait and deter Communist China from
            invading Taiwan. US military intervention forced Mao’s government to
            delay its plan to invade Taiwan. At the same time, with US backing,
            the ROC regime on Taiwan continued to hold China’s seat in the
            United Nations.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Aid from the US and a successful land reform program helped the ROC
            government solidify its control over the island and modernize the
            economy. However, under the pretext of ongoing civil war, Chiang
            Kai-shek continued to suspend the ROC constitution and Taiwan
            remained under martial law. Chiang’s government began allowing local
            elections in the 1950s, but the central government remained under
            authoritarian one-party rule by the KMT.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Chiang promised to fight back and recover the mainland and built up
            troops on islands off the Chinese coast still under ROC control. In
            1954, an attack by Chinese Communist forces on those islands led the
            US to sign a Mutual Defense Treaty with Chiang’s government.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When a second military crisis over the ROC-held offshore islands in
            1958 led the US to the brink of war with Communist China, Washington
            forced Chiang Kai-shek to officially abandon his policy of fighting
            back to the mainland. Chiang remained committed to recovering the
            mainland through an anti-communist propaganda war based on Sun
            Yat-sen’s Three Principles of the People (三民主義).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After Chiang Kai-shek’s death in 1975, his son Chiang Ching-kuo led
            Taiwan through a period of political, diplomatic and economic
            transition and rapid economic growth. In 1972, the ROC lost its seat
            in the United Nations to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In 1979, the United States switched diplomatic recognition from
            Taipei to Beijing and ended it military alliance with the ROC on
            Taiwan. That same year, the US Congress passed the Taiwan Relations
            Act, which commits the U.S. to help Taiwan defend itself from attack
            by the PRC.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Meanwhile, on the Chinese mainland, the Communist Party regime in
            Beijing began a period of “reform and opening” after Deng Xiao-ping
            took power in 1978. Beijing changed its Taiwan policy from armed
            “liberation” to “peaceful unification” under the “one country, two
            systems” framework. At the same time, the PRC refused to renounce
            the possible use of force against Taiwan.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Despite Deng’s political reforms, Chiang Ching-kuo continued a
            policy of “no contact, no negotiation, no compromise” toward the
            Communist Party regime in Beijing. The younger Chiang’s strategy for
            recovering the mainland focused on making Taiwan into a “model
            province” that would demonstrate the shortcomings of the communist
            system in mainland China.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Through government investment in high-tech, export-oriented
            industries, Taiwan experienced an “economic miracle” and its economy
            became one of Asia’s ‘four little dragons.’ In 1987, shortly before
            his death, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law in Taiwan, ending the
            40-year suspension of the ROC constitution and allowing political
            liberalization to begin. In the same year, Chiang also allowed
            people in Taiwan to visit relatives on the mainland for the first
            time since the end of the Chinese Civil War.
